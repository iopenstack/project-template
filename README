This script creates a new Java project with some dependencies already set up.
Just run './newproject.py' and answer the questions.

The types of projects it will set up are an empty Java project, or two types
of Hadoop MapReduce applications.

When the project has been created, you can use ant to compile and test your
project, as well as install it to a local .m2 repository.
